## Introduction

Kubernetes security is a top priority, and one way to enhance security is by implementing security hardening practices. This repository demonstrates how to achieve security hardening with image whitelisting in Kubernetes using OPA Gatekeeper. OPA Gatekeeper allows you to enforce policies and constraints on your Kubernetes resources to ensure they adhere to your organization's security standards.

## Manifest Files

This repository includes the following Kubernetes manifest files:

1. `constraint-template-crd.yaml`: Defines a Constraint Template Custom Resource Definition (CRD) used to define a set of constraints. It contains parameters and a Rego policy that specify the constraints to be enforced. Parameters can be configured to tailor the behavior of the Rego policy.
   
2. `constraint-policy-crd.yaml`: Defines a Constraint Custom Resource based on the Constraint Template. A Constraint Object enforces a set of constraints on specific Kubernetes resources. It is created by referencing a Constraint Template and providing values for any parameters defined in the template. The resulting Constraint Object can be associated with specific Kubernetes resources at the cluster, namespace, or resource level.

## Usage

To implement security hardening with image whitelisting in your Kubernetes cluster using the provided manifest files and OPA Gatekeeper, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/radeeka/kubernetes-security-hardening-with-OPA.git
   ```

2. Change into the cloned directory.
   ```shell
   cd kubernetes-security-hardening-with-OPA
   ```

3. Customize the `constraint-template-crd.yaml` and `constraint-policy-crd.yaml` files to define your organization's specific security constraints and policies. Adjust parameter values and Rego policies as needed.

4. Apply the Constraint Template and Constraint Object to your Kubernetes cluster.
   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f constraint-template-crd.yaml
   kubectl apply -f constraint-policy-crd.yaml
   ```

5. Monitor and enforce security hardening policies on your Kubernetes resources using OPA Gatekeeper.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the provided manifest files to match your organization's security requirements and policies. Adapt the Rego policies and parameters in the Constraint Template to align with your specific use cases.

## Constraints

Ensure that you define and document your security constraints and policies clearly. This repository serves as a starting point, and it's essential to tailor the configurations to meet your organization's security needs effectively.
